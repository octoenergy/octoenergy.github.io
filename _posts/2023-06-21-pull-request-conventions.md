At Kraken Tech we use GitHub pull requests for our reviews. Over the years we've adopted a
set of conventions to make sure we get the most out of the reviewing process.

We've recently revamped them and [published them on our public conventions](https://github.com/octoenergy/conventions/blob/master/pull-requests.md).
Take a look, and feel free to use / fork for your own team.

Here are three of my favourites:

- [Ensure your reviewers have enough context](https://github.com/octoenergy/conventions/blob/master/pull-requests.md#ensure-your-reviewers-have-enough-context)
- [Do only one thing with each commit](https://github.com/octoenergy/conventions/blob/master/pull-requests.md#do-only-one-thing-with-each-commit)
- [Keep pull requests small](https://github.com/octoenergy/conventions/blob/master/pull-requests.md#keep-prs-small)
