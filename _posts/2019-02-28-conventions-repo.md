We've published our in-house coding conventions in a public Github repo: [github.com/octoenergy/conventions](https://github.com/octoenergy/conventions). It contains
guidelines for:

- Python and Django code;
- CSS and SASS;
- HTML templates for the web and email;
- Git usage.

There's lots of useful information there: hard-won lessons from building a large
platform and the challenges that come with it.

The document is constantly evolving. We continually reflect on our codebase and
use the document to codify new conventions and patterns. 

It's useful as a reference in code-review comments, to provide the
detailed reasoning behind design decisions.

We keep it in a public repo as we believe the conventions will be useful to
other teams building large Django applications.  Hopefully it will prove a
valuable resource.

Please let us know if you find it useful.
